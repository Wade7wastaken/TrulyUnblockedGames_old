## Minifying

It is recommended to minify the javascript files before putting them on your server for production. This will make the emulator load faster (and use less bandwidth)

to minify, first, if you do not have nodejs, please install it from [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

then, open a terminal window and navigate to the minify directory

then, run `npm i`

then, run `node index.js`
